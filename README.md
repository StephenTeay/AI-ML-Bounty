In this notebook we will be doing some sentiment analysis in python using two different techniques:

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) - Bag of words approach
Roberta Pretrained Model from ðŸ¤—
Huggingface Pipeline

Read in Data and NLTK Basics
The dataset which is the Reviews.csv is read using pandas

VADER Seniment Scoring
We will use NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to get the neg/neu/pos scores of the text.

This uses a "bag of words" approach:
Stop words are removed
each word is scored and combined to a total score.

Roberta Pretrained Model
Use a model trained of a large corpus of data.
Transformer model accounts for the words but also the context related to other words.

Review Examples:
Positive 1-Star and Negative 5-Star Reviews
